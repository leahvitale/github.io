      <p>This is the third web page for the first coding lab for GIS 3410, Web Mapping, from MSU Denver.</p>
    
    <h3>About Me:</h3>
      <p>I am taking this course as a requirement for my GIS minor and certificate from MSU Denver. 
        I am looking forward to being a strong candidate for a field research position in Wildlife Biology after I graduate in December 2023. 
        Some other GIS classes that I have enjoyed at MSU Denver have been:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Remote Sensing</li>
        <li>Spatial Modeling in Raster</li>
      </ol>

      <p>On top of my GIS minor/certificate, I am also a biology major. Some biology classes I have taken that make me a good candidate to be a Wildlife Biologist are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Vertebrate Zoology</li>
        <li>Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy</li>
        <li>Animal Ecology</li>
        <li>Issues in Conservation Biology</li>
        <li>Ornithology</li>
        <li>General Botany</li>
      </ul>

    <p>I have also taken a few field experience courses, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Principles of Wildlife Biology and Management</li>
      <img src="POWM.jpg"/>
      <li>Field Ornithology</li>
      <img src="FO.jpg"/>
      <li>Tropical Field Biology - Study Abroad in Costa Rica</li>

      MSU Denver students can discover Study Abroad programs like this and others through the <a href="https://www.msudenver.edu/international-studies/go-abroad/programs/"> Student Study Abroad Program Options! </a>
     
     
    </ul>

    <h2>I am graduating on the 15th of December, 2023! To finish my degree, I have to pass the following classes:</h2>
