      <p>This is the first coding lab for GIS 3410, Web Mapping, from MSU Denver.</p>
    
    <h3>About Me:</h3>
      <p>I am taking this course as a requirement for my GIS minor and certificate from MSU Denver. 
        I am looking forward to being a strong candidate for a field research position in Wildlife Biology after I graduate in December 2023. 
        Some other GIS classes that I have enjoyed at MSU have been:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Remote Sensing</li>
        <li>Spatial Modeling in Raster</li>
      </ol>

      <p></p>I am also a biology major. Some biology classes I have taken that make me a good candidate to be a Wildlife Biologist are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Vertebrate Zoology</li>
        <li>Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy</li>
        <li>Animal Ecology</li>
        <li>Issues in Conservation Biology</li>
        <li>Ornithology</li>
      </ul>
